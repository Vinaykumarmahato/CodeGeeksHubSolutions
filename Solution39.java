/*

Given an array arr[] denoting heights of N towers and a positive integer K.

For each tower, you must perform exactly one of the following operations exactly once.

Increase the height of the tower by K
Decrease the height of the tower by K
Find out the minimum possible difference between the height of the shortest and tallest towers after you have modified each tower.

You can find a slight modification of the problem here.
Note: It is compulsory to increase or decrease the height by K for each tower. After the operation, the resultant array should not contain any negative integers.

Example 1:

Input:
K = 2, N = 4
Arr[] = {1, 5, 8, 10}
Output:
5
Explanation:
The array can be modified as 
{1+k, 5-k, 8-k, 10-k} = {3, 3, 6, 8}. 
The difference between 
the largest and the smallest is 8-3 = 5.
Example 2:

Input:
K = 3, N = 5
Arr[] = {3, 9, 12, 16, 20}
Output:
11
Explanation:
The array can be modified as
{3+k, 9+k, 12-k, 16-k, 20-k} -> {6, 12, 9, 13, 17}. 
The difference between 
the largest and the smallest is 17-6 = 11. 
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function getMinDiff() which takes the arr[], n, and k as input parameters and returns an integer denoting the minimum difference.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N*logN)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints
1 ≤ K ≤ 109
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ Arr[i] ≤ 109
