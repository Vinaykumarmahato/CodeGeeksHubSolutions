/*
Given two integers m and n, try making a special sequence of numbers seq of length n such that

seqi+1 >= 2*seqi 
seqi > 0
seqi <= m
Your task is to determine total number of such special sequences possible.

Example 1:

Input: 
m = 10
n = 4
Output: 
4
Explaination: 
There should be n elements and 
value of last element should be at-most m. 
The sequences are {1, 2, 4, 8}, {1, 2, 4, 9}, 
{1, 2, 4, 10}, {1, 2, 5, 10}.
Example 2:

Input: 
m = 5
n = 2
Output: 
6
Explaination: 
The sequences are {1, 2}, 
{1, 3}, {1, 4}, {1, 5}, {2, 4}, {2, 5}.
Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function numberSequence() which takes the number m and n as input parameters and returns the number of possible special sequences.

Expected Time Complexity: O(m*n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 â‰¤ m, n â‰¤ 100
